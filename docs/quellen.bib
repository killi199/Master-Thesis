We can explain this contrast if we think in terms of the increased start-up costs and delayed gratification associated with adopting a {VCS}. We humans typically discount the future, and therefore implementing version control in a project appears to be a fight against human nature. It's true that you can't beat the productivity boost that compilers and editors provide, but four decades after punched-card programming in assembly language has gone out of fashion, we must now look elsewhere for our next efficiency gains. And if you or your project isn't using a {VCS}, adopting one might well be the single most important tooling improvement you can undertake.},

work on an issue that was impacting the debugging capabilities in our project:
gdbserver couldn’t debug multithreaded applications running on a {PowerPC}32
architecture.  The connection to the gdbserver was broken and it couldn’t
control the debug session anymore. Multiple people have already investigated
this problem and I had a good starting point, but we still weren’t sure in
which software component the issue lied: it could have been the toolchain, the
gdbserver, the Linux kernel or the custom patches we applied on top of the
kernel tree. We were quite far away from finding the root cause.},

	abstract = {Entity resolution ({ER}) is the process of linking records that refer to the same entity. Traditionally, this process compares attribute values of records to calculate similarities and then classifies pairs of records as referring to the same entity or not based on these similarities. Recently developed graph-based {ER} approaches combine relationships between records with attribute similarities to improve linkage quality. Most of these approaches only consider databases containing
              basic entities
              that have static attribute values and static relationships, such as publications in bibliographic databases. In contrast, temporal record linkage addresses the problem where attribute values of entities can change over time. However, neither existing graph-based {ER} nor temporal record linkage can achieve high linkage quality on databases with
              complex entities
              , where an entity (such as a person) can change its attribute values over time while having different relationships with other entities at different points in time. In this article, we propose an unsupervised graph-based {ER} framework that is aimed at linking records of complex entities. Our framework provides five key contributions. First, we propagate positive evidence encountered when linking records to use in subsequent links by propagating attribute values that have changed. Second, we employ negative evidence by applying temporal and link constraints to restrict which candidate record pairs to consider for linking. Third, we leverage the ambiguity of attribute values to disambiguate similar records that, however, belong to different entities. Fourth, we adaptively exploit the structure of relationships to link records that have different relationships. Fifth, using graph measures, we refine matched clusters of records by removing likely wrong links between records. We conduct extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets from different domains showing that on average our unsupervised graph-based {ER} framework can improve precision by up to 25\% and recall by up to 29\% compared to several state-of-the-art {ER} techniques.},

Our work is presented here as a set of software citation principles, a discussion of the motivations for developing the principles, reviews of existing community practice, and a discussion of the requirements these principles would place upon different stakeholders.

In this chapter, we review the general state of research on entity recognition, relevant challenges and the current state of the art works on named entity recognition on Semitic languages. Specifically, we look into two case studies for Arabic and Hebrew. We also review Semitic {NLP} tasks which overlap with the named entity recognition. We close with an overview of the available resources for Semitic named entity recognition and some the open.research questions.},

	abstract = {Knowledge about software used in scientific investigations is important for several reasons, for instance, to enable an understanding of provenance and methods involved in data handling. However, software is usually not formally cited, but rather mentioned informally within the scholarly description of the investigation, raising the need for automatic information extraction and disambiguation. Given the lack of reliable ground truth data, we present {SoMeSci}-Software Mentions in Science-a gold standard knowledge graph of software mentions in scientific articles. It contains high quality annotations ({IRR}: K=.82) of 3756 software mentions in 1367 {PubMed} Central articles. Besides the plain mention of the software, we also provide relation labels for additional information, such as the version, the developer, a {URL} or citations. Moreover, we distinguish between different types, such as application, plugin or programming environment, as well as different types of mentions, such as usage or creation. To the best of our knowledge, {SoMeSci} is the most comprehensive corpus about software mentions in scientific articles, providing training samples for Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Entity Disambiguation, and Entity Linking. Finally, we sketch potential use cases and provide baseline results.},

We present a number of experiments to compare the performance of the different algorithms and show which are the best choices. We conclude with some directions for future work and open problems.},
